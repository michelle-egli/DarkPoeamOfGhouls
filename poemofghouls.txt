Ghouls and Mr.Dead

rotting flesh
smell of decay
lost one arm
wants living flesh

they do have feelings but theire heart is rotten

Mr. Dead loves Ghouls
he wants them all
he wants to love them like his own child
but they all dont want to be with him

they want to live

Mrs. Life isnt what she seems to be
But all the Ghouls are  enchanted by her
Mrs.Life isnt the good one in this story
Actually she is the bad one...

Because Ghouls cant get back to life...

THE END
